# The Mythical Man-Month
by Fred Brooks
### The Tar Pit
* The programming project converges more slowly the nearer one gets to the end, whereas one expects it to converge faster as one approaches the end.
### The MMM
- More programming projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
- Partitioning a task among multiple people requires extra communication effort, training, and intercommunication.
- Because we are uncertain about our scheduling estimates, we often lack the courage to defend them stubbornly against management and customer pressure.
- Adding manpower to a late project makes it later.
- Adding people to a software project increases the total effort necessary in three ways: the work and disruption of repartitioning itself, training the new people, and added intercommunication.
<br>
Rule of thumb for scheduling a software task:<br>
- 1/3 planning & design<br>
- 1/6 coding<br>
- 1/4 component test and early system test<br>
- 1/4 system testing<br>

1. The fraction developed for planning is larger than normal. Even so, it is barely enough to produce a detailed and solid specification, and not enough to include research or exploration of totally new techniques.
2. Half of the schedule is devoted to debugging completed code is much larger than average.
3. The part that is easy to estimate, such as coding, is given only 1/6 of the schedule.
